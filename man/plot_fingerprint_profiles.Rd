\title{Plot fingerprint profiles as faceted bars (robust scaling, NA-safe)}
\usage{
plot_fingerprint_profiles(
  fingerprint_df,
  scale_A = NULL,
  title = "Each metric is rescaled to [-1,1] with 0 anchored; NA shown in grey",
  metric_cols = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fingerprint_df}{A data frame returned by `extract_fingerprint()` or
a stacked set of fingerprints (e.g., `reference_fingerprints`).
It should contain the five metric columns (any of the common aliases
are accepted; see below).}

\item{scale_A}{Optional numeric. If provided, all panels are scaled by the
same amplitude `A` (recommended: compute once from your reference set and
pass it in so case/reference are perfectly comparable). If `NULL`,
the function computes `A` from the supplied data only.}

\item{title}{Character. Plot title.}

\item{metric_cols}{Optional character vector of the five preferred metric
  column names to draw (defaults are shown below). If `NULL`, the function
  will use these defaults and auto-rename common legacy aliases in
  `fingerprint_df` to match.

Preferred metric names (defaults):
\itemize{
  \item Abundance–Fitness Slope
  \item Stress Response
  \item Interaction Strength (R-squared)
  \item Diversity–Fitness Link
  \item Functional Redundancy
}
Accepted legacy aliases include e.g. \code{"Abundance_Fitness Slope"},
\code{"Interaction Strength (R_squared)"}, \code{"Functional_Redundancy"}, etc.}
}
\value{
A \pkg{ggplot2} object.
}
\description{
Visualize one or more fingerprints as faceted bar charts, with a common
rescaled axis in [-1, 1]. Missing metrics (NA) are drawn as grey "ghost"
bars at 0 and do not affect the scaling. The direction (left/right) always
follows the sign of the original value.
}
\examples{
# A: use reference amplitude so panels are comparable
A_ref <- max(abs(unlist(reference_fingerprints[
  , c("Abundance–Fitness Slope","Stress Response",
      "Interaction Strength (R-squared)","Diversity–Fitness Link",
      "Functional Redundancy")]
)), na.rm = TRUE)
plot_fingerprint_profiles(reference_fingerprints, scale_A = A_ref)

# B: plot a single case using the same A
# plot_fingerprint_profiles(fp_case, scale_A = A_ref)
}
