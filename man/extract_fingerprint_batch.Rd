\title{Extract Fingerprints for Theoretical Mechanisms}
\usage{
extract_fingerprint_batch(
  mechanisms = c("Nutritional", "Defensive", "Neutral", "FreeRider"),
  idealized = TRUE,
  n = 10000,
  noise = 0.1,
  seed = 123
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mechanisms}{A character vector of mechanisms to generate.}

\item{idealized}{Logical. If TRUE (the default), returns the perfect,
noise-free theoretical fingerprints. If FALSE, runs a noisy simulation
to generate the fingerprints.}

\item{n}{Number of hosts (only used if `idealized = FALSE`).}

\item{noise}{Noise level (only used if `idealized = FALSE`).}

\item{seed}{Optional seed for reproducibility (only used if `idealized = FALSE`).}
}
\value{
A tibble of theoretical fingerprints.
}
\description{
Generates a standardized library of mechanistic fingerprints. By default, it
returns the idealized, noise-free theoretical fingerprints.
