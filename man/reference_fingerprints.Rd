\title{Theoretical Reference Fingerprints for Symbiotic Mechanisms}
\format{
A tibble/data.frame with 4 rows and 7 columns:

\describe{
  \item{fingerprint_id}{Unique identifier for each reference profile (e.g., "ref_Defensive").}
  \item{Mechanism}{The name of the symbiotic archetype: "Nutritional", "Defensive", "Neutral", "FreeRider".}
  \item{Abundance–Fitness Slope}{Expected slope in baseline (no-stress) conditions.}
  \item{Stress Response}{Expected difference in slope between stress vs. no-stress conditions.}
  \item{Interaction Strength (R-squared)}{Expected signal clarity of the abundance–fitness relationship.}
  \item{Diversity–Fitness Link}{Placeholder (currently NA) for the diversity–fitness association metric.}
  \item{Functional Redundancy}{Placeholder (currently NA) for functional redundancy metric.}
}
}
\usage{
reference_fingerprints
}
\description{
A built-in reference library of "macro-fingerprint" profiles for four
theoretical symbiotic archetypes. These serve as the baseline against which
observed fingerprints are compared in \code{\link{diagnose_mechanism}} and
\code{\link{diagnose_mechanism_dual}}.
}
\details{
This dataset provides the idealized, noise-free predictions of the
MHG-SI framework. Each row corresponds to one mechanistic universe,
defined by its expected values on the five diagnostic metrics.
